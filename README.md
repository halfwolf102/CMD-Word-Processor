# CMD-Word-Processor
Proof-of-concept Windows command line word processsor

This is a project was created in my spare time as a proof-of-concept. It is intended to be a fully functional command-line word processor. Please feel free to provide feedback and let me know if any bugs are discovered.

Additionally, feel free to contact me with ideas for future command-line projects.
